Mert has finished his 2nd year at UCSB!
He only took 1 class ([Matrix Analysis and Computation](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/education/courses/cmpsc-211a)) which is in Fall Quarter.
He enjoyed the half of the academic year, whereas during the second half the pandemic has started. Despite this unfortunate event was happening,
he submitted an academic paper and waiting for the reviews.
