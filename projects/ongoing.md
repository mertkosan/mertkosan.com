## Event Detection on Dynamic Networks
Period: September 2018 - Present  
Location: [UC Santa Barbara - Dynamo](https://dynamo.cs.ucsb.edu/)
Project Type: Research

We proposed an event detection framework for dynamic graphs **Graph Convolutional Networks.** 
A very simple figure below illustrates, we are creating **time series data** from the dynamic graphs and trying to learn a pattern which can predict/detect an event. 
We implemented and tested the framework on multiple datasets. It is currently on submission (2020).
