## Event Detection on Dynamic Networks
Period: September 2018 - Present  
Location: [UC Santa Barbara - Dynamo](https://dynamo.cs.ucsb.edu/)
Project Type: Research

We proposed an event detection framework for dynamic graphs **using simple global and local graph features.** A very simple figure below illustrates, we are creating **time series data** from the dynamic graphs and trying to learn a pattern which can predict/detect an event. We implemented the framework; we are currently testing on multiple datasets and thinking/discussing about the further improvements on the framework.
